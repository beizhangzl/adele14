# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "This paper focuses on estimating the available power capacity that electrical vehicles (EVs) can provide for the reserve market and evaluating its impact on power system reliability. The proposed approach estimates the available power capacity in a probabilistic manner based on traffic conditions through Markov process, which takes into account time durations when EVs are scheduled to provide the reserve services, the battery charge depletion limit and the energy needed for transportation purposes. A method to evaluate the reliability of the combined system (conventional system plus EVs) based on the probabilistic model is presented. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show significant impact of EVs on system's reliability through the ancillary service market."
