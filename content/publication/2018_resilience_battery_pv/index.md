# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "This paper investigates electric vehicle (EV) participation in the flexible ramp market. We take into account EV stochastic mobility, and evaluate impact on power system reliability and flexibility. Based on dynamic programming, the model deals with uncertainties and variations of net load, as well as EV charging requirements. Markov process is utilized in estimating the aggregated power capacity of EVs. Two participation modes are analyzed: 1) EV direct provision of the ramp product; and 2) EV cooperation with the conventional generator. Moreover, we propose new indices to evaluate power system flexibility. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach and illustrate how EV involvement into the ramp market can improve power system reliability and flexibility."
