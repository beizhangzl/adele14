# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "This paper proposes an optimal sizing and siting scheme for the battery storage and photovoltaic generation aiming at improving power system resilience. The concept of capacity accessibility for both electricity demand and non-black-start (NB-S) generating units is proposed to evaluate the reachability to the power and energy capacity during extreme events. Priority of the NB-S generating units, characterized by their different importance during the black start process, is also taken into account. The unknowable nature of the extreme events is captured and modeled through a multi-objective optimization formulation to balance three main objectives: 1) the investment and operation costs; 2) the capacity accessibility for electricity demand; and 3) the capacity accessibility for NB-S generating units. The proposed approach is validated through numerical experiments, which illustrate how the new planning approach can help enhance the grid resilience."
